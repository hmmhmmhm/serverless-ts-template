# Welcome to Serverless!
#
# This file is the main config file for your service.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# You can always add more config options for more control.
# We've included some commented out config examples here.
# Just uncomment any of them to get that config option.
#
# For full config options, check the docs:
#    https://docs.serverless.com
#    https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml
#
# Happy Coding!
